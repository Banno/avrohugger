These tests pass when run in their own `sbt run`, but fail intermittently 
with `sbt-scripted`, with each with a variety of possible errors such as:

CyclicReference: : illegal cyclic reference involving object AvroType  (AvroType.scala:269)

NullPointerException

MissingRequirementError: : term fromTypeHelper in com.gensler.scalavro.types.AvroType not found.

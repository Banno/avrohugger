    This is an indented block and should be shown as
    such.

Here is a code block that apparently does not work for avrodoc. E.g. no [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) support.

```ruby
# this is a Ruby code block
def method(arg1, arg2=nil)
  puts "hello world!"
end
